## Description of APP  
This APP shows Vancouver's historical crime data in geo-temporal form. It displays a choropleth of City of Vancouver for showing neighbourhood crime comparisons and a line chart for showing individual neighbourhood crime trends.
  
On the choropleth (crime map), the number of crimes in different neighbourhoods is normalized and colour-coded so that users relate the count of a crime type to its relative location in Vancouver. A dropdown list is provided for choosing the crime type. There is also a slider bar for changing the year range of the crime data in case some users are interested in more recent crime data. A second slider bar is provided to change the color saturation of the choropeth to different maximum crime indexes. This allows the user to remove high crime neighbourhood outliers and still show color comparisons for lower crime neighbourhoods.
  
In the line chart (crime trend chart), the count of crimes in a neighbourhood is shown as varied over a time scale. Two dropdowns are provided for selecting two neighbourhoods, and another for selecting the time scale.

## Functionalities
